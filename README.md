# Jenkinsfile Build Tutorial

The following is a simple Hugo site that can be used to demonstrate how to create a Jenkinsfile Pipeline build job. The master branch will hold as defined and basic [Hugo SSG](https://gohugo.io) site. To use this site you'll need to fork this repo to your own GitHub account then from there add your own Jenkinsfile.

If you found this repo outside of the article that explains how to use it, then click [here]() to go to that article and go through the step by step process for yourself.

**Note:** The master branch is just the basic Hugo site to be used, make sure to fork that branch. But if you want to see the working Jenkinsfile I used to build this site and deploy it to a web server you can checkout the branch `finial-jenkins-build`. But you really should just follow along using the article above and after forking this repo build your own Hugo site using Jenkins!
